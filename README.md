# fungsi

### It will never be finished <br> Cause - eternal rewriting and studying

---

Inspired by Lisps, Haskell, Go and other little things :)

- call-by-value
- HOF and closures
- gradual typing
- effects (?)
- Go interop (?)
- macros

```smalltalk 
f := @[x y : int | r := + x y
             println r, ^r] : int
```
