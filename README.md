# fungsi

### It will never be finished 

---

Inspired by Racket, Clojure, Haskell, Go and maybe [Verse](https://simon.peytonjones.org/assets/pdfs/haskell-exchange-22.pdf) :).

- call-by-value
- HOF and closures
- gradual typing
- Go interop (?)
- macros

```smalltalk 
f := @[x y : int | r := + x y
             println r, ^r] : int
```
