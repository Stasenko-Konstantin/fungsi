# fungsi

### It will never be finished <br> Cause - eternal rewriting and studying

---

Inspired by Haskell, Go, Scheme and other little things :)

- call-by-value
- HOF and closures
- gradual (optional) typing with type inference (?)
- macros

```haskell 
f :IO (:Int) x y :int = do
  r = x + y
  println r
  return r 
```
