# fungsi

### It will never be finished <br> Cause - eternal rewriting and studying

---

Inspired by Haskell, Go, Scheme and other little things :)

- call-by-value
- HOF and closures
- gradual (optional) typing with type inference (?)
- macros

```ats 
f (x, y :int) :int := 
    let r <- x + y in
      begin
        println r
        r
```
